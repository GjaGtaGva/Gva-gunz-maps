Gunz maps made by GjaGta, mostly using GTK Radiant. 
Do use them on your server if you want. Feel free to edit them and make your own versions - I .

Each folder contains the map files in a folder, zip and mrs, plus some extra files (screenshots, gtk .map source file, notes).

Some maps are not lit, they will have no .LM file.

HP/AP/Ammo spawns are not set on my maps, I just can't get them to work. Player spawn rotations may be chaotic too.
